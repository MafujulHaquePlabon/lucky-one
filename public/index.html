      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <p class="">Responses are declarative, component-based etc. React is a JavaScript library that efficiently creates user interfaces (UI). This is to help me create a single page application. react transpliler is called babel. When we write code, react makes a copy of it and creates virtual DOM.The next time we write code or change a code with a virtual DOM, it compares the new DOM with the previous one. Then the new change just changes. It also generates, updates, and destroys react internally to extract the DOM element tree that needs to be rendered in the react browser.Following the React Diff-Algorithm and the lifecycle occurs.</p>

        <h5 class="text-center ">How does useState() Work?</h5>
        <p>
          We know that,useState is a hook that allows me to have state variables in elements. I pass the initial state to this function and a current state value provides a variable with another function to update this value.If I want to set an initial value for the variable, I will pass the initial value as an argument to the useState function. When the feedback first runs my component, UseState will return the two-component array as usual but will set the initial value to the first component of the array.
